All the relevant recommendations made by you have been considered and the necessary updates have been made. We were slightly confused by your recommendation made for guideline 4.0. Our App Design has been the same for the past many builds and this point wasn't brought forward previously. However, we've taken your feedback into account and made the relevant updates for tablet dimensions. 

We are excited to get our new update onto to the hands of our users. There are several critical fixes in this release that need to go out soon, and we are looking forward to completing the review process soon.

Let us know if you have any queries. We will be extremely prompt in our communication and would be sincerely grateful for your pace.

We look forward to your positive feedback!

Thank You

Regards,
Team Fello
